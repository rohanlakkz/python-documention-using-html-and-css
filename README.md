# python-documention-using-html-and-css
hey there these is the 3rd technical project using html and css out of 5 projects i wil be posting 
used html to structure the python explaination document 
this time i have learnt to how keep organize the code which was not done boosting my html knowlege to whole new level
now i am able classify where the problem lies making problem-solving path to programming but not there yet 
challenging part was navbar and navlink having so much criteria but now after writing the code it looks easier than ever
stil i could not grasp the css part of the documentaion and took help of chat-gpt to  style the css
next project would be css as keen objective in mind 
anyways always aspire to learn more keep coding....
